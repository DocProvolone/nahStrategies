# nahStrategies
"nahStrategies" is a pretty small and ambitious project, looking at creating a reliable and super easy to use Expert Advisor to trade USD major pairs.
The project is currently only supported in MetaTrader 5, and all the documentation is written about its MQL5 variant. Once the MT5 version will be cosnidered "ready for use in live market conditions", versions for other trading platforms will probably be released.
Hope you enjoy it :)
